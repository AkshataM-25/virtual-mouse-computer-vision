# Hand gesture–based virtual mouse using OpenCV and MediaPipe.

# Project Overview
- This project is a computer vision–based virtual mouse system that allows users to control mouse operations using hand gestures in real time.
- The system detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe and processes gestures using OpenCV to perform mouse actions without using a physical mouse.
- This project demonstrates touchless human-computer interaction and can be useful for accessibility systems, smart interfaces, and future AR/VR applications.

# Features
- Real-time hand gesture detection
- Cursor movement using hand motion
- Left click, right click, and double click
- Drag and drop using fist gesture
- Vertical and horizontal scrolling
- System volume control using hand gestures
- System brightness control using hand gestures

# Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- PyAutoGUI
- PyCAW (for volume control)
- Screen Brightness Control Library

# Research Publication
The research work of this project was published on the IJARSCT platform, explaining the system design, implementation, and results.
